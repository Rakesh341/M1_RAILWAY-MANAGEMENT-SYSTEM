# TEST PLAN:

## High level test plan

| Test ID | Description | Expected Input | Expected Output | Actual Output | Type Of Test |
| ----- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------ | ----- | ----- | ---------- |
| H_01 | Check if the Management selects an option from the available choices,if not from choice given it will break | SUCCESS | SUCCESS | Requirement based |      |	
| H_02 | Check if the Management selects an option from the available choices, and if yes they it will continue the case | Management's choice, an integer | SUCCESS |	SUCCESS     |Requirement based |
| H_03 | if management selects case 1:Train numbers using Bubble Sort Algorithm,2:Train names using Selection sort algorithm,3:Passenger names using Insertion Sort algorithm,4:PNR numbers using Quick Sort algorithm | Management gives details as interger | PASS |	SUCCESS | Technical |
| H_04 | It asks details of passengers and train like passenger name,train number | Management gives details as interger and charcter |	SUCCESS |	SUCCESS |	Required based |
| H_05 | Details are sorted according to selected case | Management choice as an integer |	SUCCESS |	SUCCESS |	Required based |

## Low level test plan

| Test ID |	Description |	Expected Input |	Expected Output |	Actual Output |	Type Of Test |
| ------ | -------------------- | --------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| L_01 | When choosing from the options, check if the input is valid or invalid | Management's Choice | Invalid Message/ Invoke the process | SUCCESS |	Scenario based |

| L_03 | Details are sorted according to selected case | Management choice as an integer | SUCCESS |	SUCCESS |	SUCCESS |
