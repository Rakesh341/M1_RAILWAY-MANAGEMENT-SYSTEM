# Railway Management System(RMS)

## Introduction:-

## What is Railway Management System ?

* In Railway Management System, we need to sort the various train details into a particular order in order to maintain it in a organised form. So firstly we take all the input details required from the passengers and then sort all the details accordingly. First module includes sorting train numbers using bubble sort. Second module includes sorting train names using selection sort. Third module includes sorting passenger names using insertion sort. And last module includes sorting PNR numbers using quick sort.

## Objectives Of Project:-

* The purpose of this project is to develop “Railway Management System” which takes all the customer details and travel details as input and sorts all the information using various sort to arrange them in an organized manner. This code is basically written as a solution to the drawbacks of existing problems of arranging things in a particular order. This application can be used as a real world application and by any organization.

## Benefits

* Railway Management System enables the customer details and travel details as input and sorts all the information using various sorts to arrange them in an organized manner.

## Effective Management

* This system is effective, saves time of management. Thus, it saves organization resources and expenses.

## Defining System:-

## Explanation:-
## Railway Management has some features.

* Management selects the case which they want(Case 1: Train numbers using Bubble Sort Algorithm Case 2:Train names using Selection sort algorithm, Case 3: passenger names using Insertion Sort algorithm, Case 4: PNR numbers using Quick Sort algorithm)the train details are sorted according to selected case

## 4W's and 1'H

## Who:

    * Railway Management System is a software solution by providing organized form. This system is used for any kind of train details into a particular order in order to maintain it in a organized form 
## What:

    * It is helpful for the management to save time.
     
## When:

    * The Railway Management System is now used in Railway department for easy sorting 
     
## Where:

    * Face the issues in collection of train details.
    
## How:

     * This issue can be solved by requesting any proof i.e ticket. 
     
## Detail requirements 

## High Level Requirements:

| ID | Description | Category | Status |
| ---- | -------------------------- | ------ | ----- |
| HR01 | Management should be able to select the choice | Techincal | TBD-S1 |
| HR01 | Management should be able to enter Train names | Techincal | TBD-S1 |
| HR02 | Management should be able to enter Passenger names | Techincal | TBD-S1 |
| HR03 | Management should be able to enter PNR numbers | Techincal | TBD-S1 |
| HR04 | Management should be able to enter Train numbers | Techincal | TBD-S1 |
| HR05 | Details should be sorted according to selected case |	Techincal | TBD-S1 |


## Low level Requirements:

| ID | Description | HLR ID | Status (Implemented/Future) |
| ---- | -------------------------------------- | ---- | ----- |
| LR01 | Management should be able to select the choice | HR01 | TBD-S1 |
| LR02 | Management should be able to select choice 1 i.e Train numbers using Bubble Sort Algorithm | HR02 | TBD-S1 |
| LR03 | Management should be able to select choice 2 i.e Train names using Selection sort algorithm | HR02 | TBD-S1 |
| LR04 | Management should be able to select choice 3 i.e Passenger names using Insertion Sort algorithm | HR02 | TBD-S1 |
| LR06 | Management should be able to select choice 4 i.e PNR numbers using Quick Sort algorithm | HR04 | TBD-S1 |
| LR05 | Management should be able to Enter number of Passengers,enter Passenger Name,enter PNR Number,enter Train name,enter Train name | HR06 | TBD-S1 |
| LR06 | Details should be sorted according to selected case | HR07 | TBD-S1 |


## Best methods followed
 * Used functions to decrease dependency on main function.
 * Used structures and arrays and sorting algorithms to accept the inputs from user and store the values which helped in creating easy design of raliway management system.
 * Printf statements have been placed only wherever necessary to avoid confusions.
 * Created header file so that the fuctions can be used else where ever required without any difficulty.
 * Unit testing is done to avoid any computational errors.
